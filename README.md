# My Postprocessing scripts (Jupyter Notebooks mainly) for SIESTA and Quantum Espresso

#### Mainly a place for me to keep backups and share with research group members - feel free to message me.

Dielectric functions, dos values, energies are from SIESTA code

[SIESTA code and documentation](docs.siesta-project.org/projects/siesta/en/school-2021/tutorials/optical-properties/)
[SIESTA math and background theory](https://siesta-project.org/SIESTA_MATERIAL/Docs/Tutorials/Lyon-2007/Optical.pdf)

*siesta_dos* get DOS, COHP, COOP given electornic structure (optimize seperately)

*Plot_DOS* Various DOS and Polarization plots using siesta outputs for DOS, COHP, COOP from siesta_dos and new_dos folder.

Folder optical_polymer_dielectric contains raw data and parsing notebooks for everything from dielectric function to absorption coefficient. Unfortunatly you will have to point to each file seperatly. 
Use terminal command  'find  ./*' to print all paths/folders in path of '.' to shorten this process.
